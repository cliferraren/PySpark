Here, I learned how to use Spark from Python! Spark is a tool for doing parallel computation with large datasets and it integrates well with Python. PySpark is the Python package that makes the magic happen. I used this package to work with data starting from the basics.

[Basics:](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/tree/master/Basics)
 1. [Working with CSV](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Working_with_CSV_file.ipynb)
 2. [Working with JSON](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Working_with_JSON_file.ipynb)
 3. [Filtering of Data](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Apply_Filtering.ipynb)
 4. [Filtering of Data with CSV](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Apply_Filtering_SecondPart.ipynb)
 
Demo Analysis:
 1. [RainFall Analysis](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Rainfall_Analysis.ipynb)
 2. [Bigfoot Sightings](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Bigfoot_Sightings_Analysis.ipynb)


I also learn to wrangle with data and build a whole machine learning pipeline to predict Yelp Reviews. This is a introductory Spark in Python codes and to be ready to dive into the world of high performance machine learning! 

[NLP:](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/tree/master/NLP)
 1. [Count Words Through Tokenization](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/NLP/Count_Words.ipynb)
 2. [Count Vowels Through Tokenization](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/NLP/Count_Vowel.ipynb)
 1. [Stop Words](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/NLP/FoodReviews_StopWords.ipynb)
 2. [NGram](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/NLP/NLP_NGram_SecondPart.ipynb)
 1. [Hashing - Airline Data](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/NLP/Airline_HashingDemo.ipynb)
 2. [CountVector Implementation - Airline Data](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/NLP/NLP_Airlines_Using_CountVector.ipynb)

Demo NLP using Naive Bayes:
 1. [Spam or Ham](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/NLP/Proj%20-%20Spam.ipynb)
 2. [Yelp Reviews](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/NLP/Proj%20-%20Yelp%20Reviews.ipynb)
