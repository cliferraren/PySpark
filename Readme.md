## PySpark

Here, I learned how to use Spark from Python! Spark is a tool for doing parallel computation with large datasets and it integrates well with Python. PySpark is the Python package that makes the magic happen. I used this package to work with data starting from the basics.

[Basics:](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/tree/master/Basics)
 1. [Working with CSV](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Working_with_CSV_file.ipynb)
 2. [Working with JSON](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Working_with_JSON_file.ipynb)
 3. [Filtering of Data](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Apply_Filtering.ipynb)
 4. [Filtering of Data with CSV](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Apply_Filtering_SecondPart.ipynb)
 
Demo Analysis:
 1. [RainFall Analysis](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Rainfall_Analysis.ipynb)
 2. [Bigfoot Sightings](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/blob/master/Basics/Bigfoot_Sightings_Analysis.ipynb)


I also learn to wrangle this data and build a whole machine learning pipeline to predict Yelp Reviews. This is a introductory Spark in Python codes and to be ready to dive into the world of high performance machine learning! 

[NLP:](https://github.com/cliferraren/PySpark/tree/master/NLP)
 1. [Simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy)
 2. [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
 3. Use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
